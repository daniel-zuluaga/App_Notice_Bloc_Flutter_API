# App Notice Bloc Flutter Api

# What is my project about?

Here in this project you can see the part of some 
unit tests and widgets, consuming apiKey to show 
the last minute top movies

Where each part of the code I tested to see if it 
works and the data arrives, I also added the exception 
error and implemented in the application when something 
fails

I also used many widgets like the list view builder, 
card to show the information, all of that is inside a 
column, I also used a widget called flutter bloc this 
helps us rebuild our app when there is a change with 
a lazy load

Also add an elevatedButton so that when the user clicks, it 
takes them to see the new news in more detail because 
it takes them to a page to see the news in detail
